# Quantum Pigeonhole Paradox in Qiskit 2.x

**Author:** Dikran Meliksetian (Qiskit Advocate)  
**Date:** 2025  
**Compatible Qiskit version:** 2.x

## 🧠 Overview
This tutorial explores the **quantum pigeonhole paradox** — a counterintuitive result from pre-/post-selection quantum mechanics, where three particles appear never to share two boxes.

We show:
1. How a **single ancilla parity check** reveals the paradox for any pair.  
2. Why using **three ancillas simultaneously** collapses the interference pattern.  
3. How a **weak, reversible probe** (compute → $R_y(ε)$ → uncompute) restores the paradox, connecting to **weak measurement theory**.

---

## 🧩 Learning Goals
- Represent pre-/post-selection circuits in Qiskit.  
- Understand ancilla-based parity checking and post-selection.  
- Observe interference collapse and recovery via weak measurement.  
- Compute weak values and confidence intervals.
